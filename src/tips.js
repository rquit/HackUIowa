            <h1>Setting Goals and Achieving Them</h1>

            <h3>Choose Specific Goals</h3>
            <p>
                This sounds obvious, but a lot of people don't actually do this. You want to set a
                goal that lets you know EXACTLY what you want to do.
                <br />
                For example, a goal like "learn coding" is too specific. There's a ton of languages
                out there, and not having specific one in mind just gives you way too many choices
                and wastes time.
                <br />
                If that was your goal, I HIGHLY suggest just picking a language like C++, JavaScript,
                Python, or anything with a huge userbase. This allows you to get easy answers for your
                questions compared to any alternative.
            </p>

            <h3>Make The Titles Short, Work In Steps</h3>
            <p>
                Put simply, rather than saying "learn HTML and CSS to make a website", you want to say
                "learn HTML", then "learn CSS", and finally "make a website". This gives you the feeling
                that you are actually accomplishing something if you get stuck. So many times people
                give up on what they want to do because they get stuck in a spot and don't know what
                to do from there.
            </p>

            <h3>Make Short Term AND Long Term Goals!</h3>
            <p>
                Just like in the previous step, you DO NOT want to only have short term or long term goals!
                An app like this is great for keeping your short term goals, but have something overarching
                in mind that you want to achieve. For example, a long term goal could be "get a job as
                a web devloper". You can now split that into shorter-term goals involving learning HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, Frontend Libraries, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>Build A Roadmap</h3>
            <p>
                I want you to find a roadmap (or make your own!) on what you want to do. This helps to organize
                these thoughts and tie in those short term goals you just made. No matter how good your memory
                is, things will get hard to keep track of eventually.

            <h3>Make Deadlines!</h3>
            <p>
                I cannot stress the importance of this. Especially as a procrastinator, deadlines are the driving
                force of our actions. Adding personal deadlines and tieing some sort of thing to important 
                thing to it not only makes you complete the goal, eventually it will add a sort of 
                rythm to your actions making it feel natural to do whatever you want to.
